# CodeKitchen
A Cooking educational game that teaches algorithms and system design through step-by-step visual gameplay.

CodeKitchen is a Cooking-Mama–style educational game designed to teach
data structures, algorithms, and system design through step-by-step visual gameplay.

Instead of memorising solutions, players perform algorithmic actions,
receive immediate feedback, and learn efficiency through visual consequences.

## Core Features
- Step-by-step algorithm gameplay
- Visual representation of data structures
- Efficiency and complexity feedback
- Friendly guidance and mistake explanation
- Interview-focused learning (DSA + System Design)

## Game Modes
### Algorithm Mode
Players solve algorithm problems by performing actions that mirror real algorithm steps.

### System Design Mode (Planned)
Players visually design systems, simulate load, and learn tradeoffs.

## Tech Stack
- Unity (2D)
- C#
